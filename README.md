# apriori
A Java program that peforms association rule mining using WEKA's apriori package.

I am generating a test suite with different combinations of input configuration values (to be used in WEKA).  
This program is designed to read test input from a CSV file, parse the input and execute the apriori algorithm from WEKA.
